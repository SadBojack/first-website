            <h2>What is the bubble economy?</h2>
            <p>From 1986 to 1991, Japan had an economic bubble known as the Japanese asset price bubble (バブル景気, baburu keiki, "bubble economy"), during which real estate and stock market prices were dramatically inflated. This pricing bubble burst at the beginning of 1992, causing Japan's economy to stall. The quick acceleration of asset prices, the overheated economic activity, the rise of the money supply, and the extension of credit were all characteristics of the bubble. More particularly, at the time, an excessive monetary easing policy was directly linked to overconfidence in and speculation about asset and stock prices. The Japanese government initiated and perpetuated a bubble in Japanese asset prices by establishing economic policies that enhanced the marketability of assets, facilitated credit availability, and promoted speculation.</p>
